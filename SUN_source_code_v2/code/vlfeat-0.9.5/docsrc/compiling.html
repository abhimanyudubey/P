<p>These instructions explain how to compile VLFeat on your own. This
can be useful to customize or contribute to VLFeat, but it is
otherwise not necessary (<b>use the
<a href="%pathto:download;">binary package</a> instead</b>).</p>

<p>For <b>UNIX</b> based platforms (Mac OS X and Linux), the library
 bundles a GNU makefile (<code>Makefile</code>). The makefile
 tries to auto-detect the environment and automatically configure
 itself. In most cases, typing <code>make</code> is all it is required
 to compile everything. If this does not work, please edit the
 makefile and make the necessary adjustment to the flags.</p>

<p>For <b>Windows</b>, the library bundles a NMake makefile
 (<code>Makefile.mak</code>). In order to use it, you must open
 Makefile.mak and adjust the values of configuration variables to match
 your setup. Once you have done that, start the Visual Studio Command
 Prompt and type <code>nmake /f Makefile.mak</code>.</p>

<p><b>Note: For Windows you can also just compile the mex files.</b> Start with
 our binary distribution.</p>

<p><b>Windows: Troubleshooting common problems:</b></p>
<dl>
 <dt>syntax error: '=' unexpected:</dt>
 <dd><p>Use <code>nmake /f Makefile.mak</code>.
   Without <code>/f</code>, nmake will default to the wrong
   makefile.</p></dd>
 <dt>'long' followed by 'long' is illegal:</dt>
 <dd><p>This error is usually caused by
   attempting to compile outside of the Visual Studio Command Prompt.</p></dd>
